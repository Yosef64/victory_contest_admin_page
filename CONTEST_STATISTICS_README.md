## Data Structure

### Statistics Object
```typescript
{
  totalParticipants: number,
  passedCount: number,
  failedCount: number,
  passRate: number,
  averageScore: number,
  genderStats: {
    male: { total: number, passed: number, failed: number, passRate: number },
    female: { total: number, passed: number, failed: number, passRate: number }
  },
  cityStats: Record<string, { total: number, passed: number, failed: number, passRate: number }>,
  schoolStats: Record<string, { total: number, passed: number, failed: number, passRate: number }>,
  gradeStats: Record<string, { total: number, passed: number, failed: number, passRate: number }>,
  scoreDistribution: { excellent: number, good: number, average: number, poor: number }
}
```

## Dependencies

### UI Components (shadcn/ui)
- Button, Card, Select, Table, Badge, Progress, Tabs, Separator
- All components are from the existing shadcn/ui library

### Icons (Lucide React)
- BarChart3, Users, CheckCircle, XCircle, TrendingUp, Filter, Download, PieChart, Target

### External Libraries
- React Query for data fetching
- Sonner for toast notifications

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Charts and Graphs**: Add visual charts using libraries like Recharts or Chart.js
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare performance across multiple contests
3. **Trend Analysis**: Show performance trends over time
4. **Advanced Filters**: Add more filtering options (date ranges, score ranges)
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live statistics updates
6. **PDF Export**: Add PDF export functionality
7. **Email Reports**: Automated email reports for contest results

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed statistics
2. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large datasets
3. **Virtual Scrolling**: Implement virtual scrolling for large tables
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load statistics on demand

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Data Displayed**: Check if contest has submissions and students
2. **Filter Not Working**: Ensure student data has the required fields (gender, city, school, grade)
3. **Export Fails**: Check browser permissions for file downloads
4. **Slow Loading**: Large datasets may take time to process

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
- Ensure all required data fields are present in student records
